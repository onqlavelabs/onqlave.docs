Alternatively, you can proceed to setup your account using our standard settings which are designed to suit most customers.</p> <p>Cloud Provider - The choice of cloud provider determines which service is used to store your information. This allows for you to choose a cloud provider that your organisation already uses, which results in ... [benefits? - speed, ?]. At present we only support Google, but more providers are coming soon.</p> <p>Region - The choice of region allows you to determine which geography you would like the data to reside. This may an important factor for data localisation / data residency requirements for sensitive data, whilst there can also be additional [speed and efficiency] benefits from having the data reside in the same geography as the rest of your information.</p> <p>Usage Limits - Implementing usage limits ensures that your organisation will not incur unexpected usage fees in case of high volumes.

You have the choice of AES-256 or [xx], with the latter offering stronger encryption but at a lower processing speed.</p> <p>Key Rotation Frequency - This determines how regularly the encryption keys are changed, to ensure that your information remains safe.

The Onqlave alpha release is designed to help you achieve this with minimum effort. </p> <p>Taking advantage of the encryption management tools of where your data is stored isn't enough to stop attackers and inside threats. Through the quick workflows available in our WebApp and CLI, you will be able to distribute the trust away from your cloud provider, to manage the encryption of that data via Onqlave. </p> <p>We have designed Onqlave to be resilient, performant and scalable whilst abstracting the complexities of key management and cryptography. With Onqlave, your data is encrypted before leaving your platform, so Onqlave doesn't see anything other than cypher - this is core to the idea that data is never exposed to those without unintended access.</p> <p>We at Onqlave know that in order to best protect your sensitive customer data it needs to be encrypted throughout its full lifecycle, to block unauthorised access yet be available for its intended application.\u00a0</p> <p>We are excited for you to get your hands on the Onqlave alpha release. We have been working towards delivering initial features which will form the foundation of an extensive suite of data protection and privacy capabilities to come in the future. We welcome any and all feedback you have along either through the WebApp or at feedback@onqlave.com</p> <p>With this alpha release, you will be able to easily create and manage a personal data store within your applications, allowing for a distributed trust architecture, meaning neither your cloud provider nor Onqlave will see any of the sensitive data you chose to encrypt, only cypher - drastically reducing the point of vulnerability you experience from internal or external threats.\u00a0</p>"},{"location":"welcome/how-it-works/","title":"How does it work?","text":""},{"location":"welcome/how-it-works/#todo-add-diagram-of-proxy-work-flow","title":"TODO: add diagram of proxy work flow","text":""},{"location":"welcome/how-it-works/#todo-add-some-explanation","title":"TODO: add some explanation","text":""}]}
