The dashboard has some important sections to remember:
- The notifications section in the top right highlights key information changes, updates and general notices that relate to Onqlave and your account.Â 
- The key purpose of the dashboard is to give you a quick snapshot of your current usage, statistics and running costs. Note about alpha not having costs?
