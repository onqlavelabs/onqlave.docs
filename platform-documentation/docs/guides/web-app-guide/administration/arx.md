If you are familiar with allocating cloud computing resources for your company, you will be familiar with the concept of creating and assigning clusters to support your expected workload. With Onqlave, we follow a similar approach to allow you to optimise for speed and availability. 

Onqlave offers serverless compute to support your scalability and will offer dedicated, single tenant clusters upon request. If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to helpdesk@onqlave.com

Setting up clusters will allow you to set parameters around your workload usage, performance and type of encryption.Â 
When creating a cluster, you will be able to specify:

- which cloud provider you would like the cluster to be deployed with (only Google is available at this time).

- regions to optimise performance

- usage limits

- the encryption method best suited for your business requirement

- the frequency of key rotation

If you would like to learn more about how the customisable settings impacts performance then read on below. Alternatively, you can proceed to setup your account using our standard settings which are designed to suit most customers.

**Cloud Provider**
- The choice of cloud provider determines which service is used to store your information. This allows for you to choose a cloud provider that your organisation already uses, which results in ... [benefits? - speed, ?]. At present we only support Google, but more providers are coming soon.

**Region**
- The choice of region allows you to determine which geography you would like the data to reside. This may an important factor for data localisation / data residency requirements for sensitive data, whilst there can also be additional [speed and efficiency] benefits from having the data reside in the same geography as the rest of your information.

**Usage Limits**
- Implementing usage limits ensures that your organisation will not incur unexpected usage fees in case of high volumes. [We will notify you in this instance, to ensure there are no unexpected fees and that impact on business performance can be managed]

**Encryption Method**
- We only offer encryption services based on the highest performance encryption algorithms. You have the choice of AES-256 or [xx], with the latter offering stronger encryption but at a lower processing speed.

**Key Rotation Frequency**
- This determines how regularly the encryption keys are changed, to ensure that your information remains safe. [Upsides and downsides?]
