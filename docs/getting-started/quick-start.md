## **Get your early access account**

Before using the Onqlave Platform, we will help you **get an account for FREE**. All you need to do is:

1. **<a href="https://www.onqlave.com/contact" target="_blank"> Please register here for our latest release </a>**
2. Activate your account by kindly going through the instructions provided via an email from Onqlave Communications (<comms@onqlave.com>)
<!-- Add comment on what to do if the email is not received? -->
After having your account ready, you can continue with your preferred way of interacting, as listed below.


## **Choose your own flavour**

After creating your account, you can easily interact with the Onqlave Platform via 2 types of interface. Please note that the managed components are the same in both.

### **1. [Graphical Interface ](../../guides/web-app-guide/overview-gui)**

This graphical interface is accessible via a web browser. You can proceed to our **[dedicated graphical interface guide](../../guides/web-app-guide/overview-gui)** and get everything ready in 5 minutes.

### **2. [Command Line Interface ](../../guides/cli-guide/overview-cli)**

The CLI is a widely preferred option for many developers and technology enthusiasts. Although we have already included a descriptive manual help command within the CLI itself, we also provide **[comprehensive CLI documentation](https://docs.onqlave.com/guides/cli-guide/overview-cli/)**.
