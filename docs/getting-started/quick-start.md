## **Get your early access account**

Before using the Onqlave Platform, we will help you **get an account for FREE**. All you need to do is:

1. **<a href="https://www.onqlave.com/contact" target="_blank"> Please register here for our latest release </a>**
2. Activate your account by kindly going through the instructions provided via an email from Onqlave Communications (<comms@onqlave.com>). If you haven't seen our email in the main inbox, you may need to check it out in the Ads/Promotion sections of your mailbox, or you can drop us a message at <product@onqlave.com>

After having your account ready, you can checkout a quick start guide in this video, including how to create basic resources in the Onqlave dashboard and use these resource with the Onqlave Go lang SDK:

## **Check the quick start video guide**

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.250%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/e/plogvh" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

## **Ready to go?**

### **Choose your own flavour of interface**

After creating your account and going through the quick start video you can easily interact with the Onqlave Platform via 2 types of interface. Please note that the managed components are the same in both.

#### **1. [Dashboard](../../guides/web-app-guide/overview-gui)**

This dashboard is accessible via a web browser. You can proceed to our **[dashboard guide](../../guides/web-app-guide/overview-gui)** and get everything ready in 5 minutes.

#### **2. [Command Line Interface ](../../guides/cli-guide/overview-cli)**

The CLI is a widely preferred option for many developers and technology enthusiasts. Although we have already included a descriptive manual help command within the CLI itself, we also provide **[comprehensive CLI documentation](https://docs.onqlave.com/guides/cli-guide/overview-cli/)**.

### **Try the SDKs**

Currently we are supporting **[Go lang SDK](../../guides/sdks/sdk-go)** and **[Node SDK](../../guides/sdks/sdk-node)**. More languages will be available soon.
