# **Alpha Release**
_{explaining the intent of the first, limited release}_

In order to preserve the privacy of your customer data, it first needs to be protected. The Onqlave alpha release is designed to help you achieve this with minimum effort. 

Taking advantage of the encryption management tools of where your data is stored isn't enough to stop attackers and inside threats. Through the quick workflows available in our WebApp and CLI, you will be able to distribute the trust away from your cloud provider, to manage the encryption of that data via Onqlave. 

We have designed Onqlave to be resilient, performant and scalable whilst abstracting the complexities of key management and cryptography. With Onqlave, your data is encrypted before leaving your platform, so Onqlave doesn't see anything other than cypher - this is core to the idea that data is never exposed to those without unintended access.

We at Onqlave know that in order to best protect your sensitive customer data it needs to be encrypted throughout its full lifecycle, to block unauthorised access yet be available for its intended application. 

We are excited for you to get your hands on the Onqlave alpha release. We have been working towards delivering initial features which will form the foundation of an extensive suite of data protection and privacy capabilities to come in the future. We welcome any and all feedback you have along either through the WebApp or at [feedback@onqlave.com](feedback@onqlave.com)

With this alpha release, you will be able to easily create and manage a personal data store within your applications, allowing for a distributed trust architecture, meaning neither your cloud provider nor Onqlave will see any of the sensitive data you chose to encrypt, only cypher - drastically reducing the point of vulnerability you experience from internal or external threats.
