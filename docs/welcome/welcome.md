## **What will you get?**

Users of the platform can achieve a distributed trust architecture. Your data is encrypted before it leaves your platform, and Onqlave only holds the encryption keys, therefore neither your cloud provider nor Onqlave see any sensitive data you choose to encrypt, only ciphertext. 

## **How can we achieve it?**
The design ensures **data is never exposed to those without access**, while reducing the reliance on your cloud provider, as this alone is not enough to prevent attackers and inside threats.

Our tools are designed to help you achieve protection with minimal effort. We have developed  and tested quick workflows in our WebApp and CLI, to enable your engineers to rapidly protect and continually manage your data.

We have designed Onqlave to be resilient, performant and scalable, whilst minimising the complexities of key management and cryptography. 

## **We value your feed back**
We are excited for you to be part of the Onqlave alpha release. We have been working towards delivering initial features which will form the foundation of an extensive suite of data protection and privacy capabilities in the near future. 

On the bottom right corner of any menu, you can see the **Provide Feedback** button.
