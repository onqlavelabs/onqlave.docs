## Our mission

Our mission is to make it easy to incorporate data privacy and protection for the management of sensitive data (PII) throughout your organisation.


## How do we achieve it?

To preserve the privacy of your data, it first needs to be protected. The Onqlave alpha release enables you to easily create and manage a personal data store within your applications. 

Users of the platform can achieve a distributed trust architecture. Your data is encrypted before it leaves your platform, and Onqlave only holds the encryption keys, therefore neither your cloud provider nor Onqlave see any sensitive data you choose to encrypt, only ciphertext. 

The design ensures data is never exposed to those without access, while reducing the reliance on your cloud provider, as this alone is not enough to prevent attackers and inside threats.

Our tools are designed to help you achieve protection with minimal effort. We have developed  and tested quick workflows in our WebApp and CLI, to enable your engineers to rapidly protect and continually manage your data.

We have designed Onqlave to be resilient, performant and scalable, whilst minimising the complexities of key management and cryptography. 

We are excited for you to be part of the Onqlave alpha release. We have been working towards delivering initial features which will form the foundation of an extensive suite of data protection and privacy capabilities in the near future. 

We welcome any and all feedback you have either through WebApp or at <feedback@onqlave.com>.
