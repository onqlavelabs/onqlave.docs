At the moment there is only one way to use the CLI via the provided docker container.

## **Before you start**

Make sure that you have <mark>[an executable docker](https://www.docker.com/)</mark> on your machine.

In addition, you can try to <mark>[get comfortable with docker](https://docs.docker.com/)</mark> before starting.

## **Get the container**

Use this command to get our docker image:

```
docker pull australia-southeast1-docker.pkg.dev/temp-control-plane/onqlave/onqlavelabs/onqlave.all:{$cli-version}
```

Replace **{$cli-version}** with your preferred version. We always recommend the latest version. You can check out <mark>[the list of our releases here](https://github.com/onqlavelabs/onqlave.all/releases)</mark> for an exact version number.

## **Launch the container**

Use this command to run the image:

```
docker run -it {$image-id} bash
```

After entering the container via BASH shell, you can try to type this command to make sure everything works:

```
# onqlave
```

The output should look like this:

```
Usage:
  onqlave [command]

Examples:
onqlave

Available Commands:
  apps        applications management
  arx         arx management

```

## **Init the configuration**

```

If the configurations was inited successfully, there should be a output like following
ðŸŽ‰ Done!  You successfully initialize your environment . Next step is to signup/login is you already haven't.
