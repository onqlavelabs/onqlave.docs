Before starting the authentication process via CLI, please make sure that you have a valid account and valid tenant name.

## **Authenticating**
The authentication process will go through 4 steps:

### **1. Input authentication information via CLI:**

Use this command to begin the authn process:

```
# onqlave auth login your_email_account@domain.com -t your-verified-tenant-name
```

After entering the above command, the output should appear as follows:
```
Login instruction is sent to email address 'your_email_count@domain.com'.
Please be mindful that the link provided in email is only valid for 30 minutes.
```

### **2. Wait for an email from Onqlave**

You should shortly receive an email at the address you provided (in the previous step).

Please note that the link contained within the email is only valid for 30 minutes.

### **3. Confirm your email**
Open your email and click on the provided link to complete the email confirmation prompt

### **4. Return to the CLI and work with an authenticated session**
After confirming your email, the CLI output should look like this:
```
