## **Add & invite a new user**

You can add your preferred user into your managed tenant by interacting with the web application. When successfully adding users to your system, our system will automatically send an invitation email with an activation link to users.


The most important part when you add a new user to your managed platform is assigning roles. Currently we support three roles:


- Platform Owner
- Platform Admin
- Developer
