## **Add & invite a new user**

You can add your preferred user into your managed tenant by interacting with the web applicaiton. When successfully adding users to your system, our system will automatically send invitation email with activation link to users. 

The most important part when you adding a new user to your managed platfor is assinging roles. Currently we support three roles:

- Platform Owner
- Platform Admin
- Developer
