## **Description**

API Keys manager allow you to bring your clusters and applications together. The API Keys created here will draw on all of the unique inputs you have created for the cluster and application that you choose.

When you create your Access key it is critical that you store it as it will only be displayed once. To preserve the integrity of the key, Onqlave does not keep a record of this. Do not close the final window  until you have made this record!


## **Create an API Key**

To create an api key, firstly, you need to select the associated application...

... and the associated Arx

You also have a summarize menu to review all the neccesary information before actually create the API key.

If the creation of API Key is success, you should save the **ACCESS KEY** into a safe place.

## **View the API Key dashboard**

You can browse the API Key dashboard as well as the Arx Dashboard and Application Dashboard.

## **Delete the API Key** 

To delete an API Key, you can simply select the one you desired and delete it.

The process is the same as archiving application and deleting arxes. However, you also have to type exact the same API Key. You can hover above your desired one and copy it in to clipboard before deleting.

After deletion, the API Key dashboard is updated instantly.
