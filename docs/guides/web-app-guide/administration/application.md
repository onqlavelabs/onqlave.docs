## **Description**

The Applications page will allow you to create and allocate the unique identifiers for your front and backend applications to be used when creating API Keys. This seperate Application workflow ensures you have easy access to enabling, disabling and archiving applications as needed.

When the application reference is created, an API token and encryption key is established. Note that Onqlave does not allow you to permanently delete any applications, however they can be archived, which will then disable the respective API token and encryption key.
