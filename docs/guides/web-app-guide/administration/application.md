## **Before you start**

The Applications page will allow you to create and allocate the unique identifiers for your front and backend applications to be used when creating API Keys. This separated Application workflow ensures you have easy access to enabling, disabling and archiving applications as needed.


When the application reference is created, an API token and encryption key is established. Note that Onqlave does not allow you to permanently delete any applications, however they can be archived, which will then disable the respective API token and encryption key.

## **Create an application**

**Who can perform this operation?**

- **[Platform Owner](../../platform/access/#1-platform-owner)**

The web app interface provides a convenient way to complete all of the required information during the process of creating an application.

You can delegate the ownership of your application to another account/user. But please pay attention to the currently supported roles and their available operations.

<!-- Confusing to link through to the Arx documentation, as the summary screen includes different information -->
You will again be provided with a summary screen to help you review all of the necessary information before actually creating the application.

## **View the application dashboard**

**Who can perform this operation?**

- **[Platform Owner](../../platform/access/#1-platform-owner)**

In the application dashboard, you can see the total number of activated, disabled and archived applications as well as some basic information for each application. You can also select any existing application to modify, disable or archive it.

![app-dashboard-1](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/0333616b-b8ef-46cc-b554-13cf832e6dd3/application-3%20(3).png)

## **Update an application**

You can also edit some basic information of an application.

![app-edit-1](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/466f5f75-0035-4fd2-8af5-4c10c7713b46/application-3%20(4).png)

## **Enable/disable an application**

**Who can perform this operation?**

- **[Platform Owner](../../platform/access/#1-platform-owner)**

You can also enable/disable an application. This is a required step before archiving it. Disabling an application requires you to type in the exact name of that application correctly.

![app-enable-disable-2](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/fecd8e9d-d02e-4d73-860c-94e4414e4365/application-3%20(5).png)

You need to type exactly the name of the application that you want to disable.

![app-enable-disable-2-1](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/b474e71f-3e05-4593-8cd4-eee6b425efe6/application-3%20(6).png)

If the enable/disable process is successful, the status of the selected application will be updated in the application dashboard.

![app-enable-disable-3](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/0cf9d024-37bf-448d-b1db-9aeaae82a3b8/application-3%20(7).png)


## **Archive an application**

**Who can perform this operation?**

- **[Platform Owner](../../platform/access/#1-platform-owner)**

Since we do not support deleting applications, you can archive it. Before archiving an application, you have to disable it (see the step above: 'Enable/disable an application').

![app-archive-1](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/0bdf9c53-0c87-4986-830c-864ddaa8e1d2/application-3%20(8).png)

Archiving an application requires you to type in the name of that application correctly.

![app-archive-2](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/a33401c0-29dc-4079-8697-ae423cc35af0/application-3%20(9).png)

If the archiving process is successful then the status of the selected application will be updated in the application dashboard.

By toggling the **Show Archived** switch, you can see the archived applications along with the active applications.


![app-archive-4](https://t36712295.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36712295/c95ae161-2fd6-428f-ba82-6b250f614720/application-3%20(10).png)
